    "Hello, we have a lot to accomplish today so let's get started. Our goal today is to create a few models in order to determine whether or not we can predict which author wrote which book. We will be capitalizing on the books provided by nltk corupus known as gutenberg. Our goal is to achieve a test score above 90%. We will dive into some feature engineering in order to examine various information such as parts of speech, punctuation, and sentence length. We will then test our models on a new book to determine whether or not our model fits well when put to the test against a new set of text. Let's begin.\n",
